Exility - The Show and Tell Rapid Web Application Development Framework

Exility is a rapid web application development framework that has come up after years of work and multiple commercial deployments. Over the last decade or so, web application development has started to follow a set design pattern. A simplistic design will have HTML pages with client side logic (like validation). Once the form is submitted, the server side will have logic with clear separation between database entities and core business logic.

While the development and design philosophy has been largely similar, the business needs of today, mandate a rapid turn around time and quicker build cycles.

This led us to create the Exility framework and development model. The framework takes care of most repeated and boiler-plate tasks, leaving the developer (and in some cases the business user) to focus on entity definition, business logic creation and HTML page definition. A large number of these could simply be defined using descriptive XML files.

In essence, it is possible to simply define XML files to create a fully functional enterprise web application.

Please note, Exility is designed to create Enterprise Web Applications (like HR systems, Payroll Systems) and is not really a good choice for creation other types of websites (like CMS and Blogs).

Simply import the contents of "Example Project" in your Eclipse IDE and get going.
